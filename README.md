# AI-Powered E-Commerce Website
<u>Problem statement</u>: A fictional company wants to integrate AI technology in their e-commerce website to enhance user experience and customer satisfaction. Their plan was to add the following AI-powered features:

- **Chatbot Assistant**: It uses a large language model (LLM) that has access to the company's internal database of products and other helpful information (e.g., delivery info, product discounts).
- **Review Analyst**: The company wants to train an internal model that is trained on 10,000 Amazon product reviews. It reads a user's review on a particular product to analyze their message's sentiment and predict the user's rating on that product.
- **Product Recommender**: A custom trained AI model is used to recommend products to users based on their preferences and purchasing style.

<u>Solution</u>: This is where they hire me to implement and integrate all of these features into the web application.

# Custom AI Models
Here is a more detailed description for each aforementioned model:
- **Chatbot Assistant**:
    1. Queries the internal database.
    2. Stores the top relevant results in an index for better retrieval.
    3. Retrieves them as embedded information.
    4. Decides to use which information to properly answer a user's question.
- **Review Analyst**:
    1. Trained on many Amazon product reviews.
    2. Preprocesses and postprocesses user and output data, respectively.
    3. Predicts and displays the rating of the user on a product given only their review about it.
- **Product Recommender**:

# Data
I got the data needed to train my AI models from the below sources:
- Products:
    - Product data was generated by Orca Mini LLM.
    - Images, hosted by Amazon and others, were downloaded from the web.
- Amazon Product Reviews:
    - I downloaded, preprocessed, and combined two separate datasets containing Amazon reviews.
    - URLs:
        - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tarkkaanko/amazon
