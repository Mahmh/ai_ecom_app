# AI-Powered E-Commerce Website
<u>Problem statement</u>: A fictional company wants to integrate AI technology in their e-commerce website to enhance user experience and customer satisfaction. Their plan was to add the following AI-powered features:

- **Chatbot Assistant**: It uses a large language model (LLM) that has access to the company's internal database of products and other helpful information (e.g., delivery info, product discounts).
- **Review Analyst**: The company wants to train an internal model that is trained on nearly 5,000 Amazon product reviews. It should read users' reviews on a particular product and analyze their sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) to provide information to the readers.
- **Product Recommender**: A trained custom AI model is used to recommend products to users based on their preferences and purchasing style.

<u>Solution</u>: This is where they hire me to implement and integrate all of these features into the web application.

# Custom AI Models
Here is a more detailed description for each aforementioned model:
- **Chatbot Assistant**:
    1. Queries the internal database.
    2. Store the top relevant results in an index for better retrieval.
    3. Pass them as embedded information to the LLM's input.
    4. The LLM decides to use which information to properly answer the users' questions.
- **Review Analyst**:
    1. Trained on many Amazon product reviews.
    2. Preprocesses and postprocesses user and output data, respectively.
    3. Displays the output to the end user.
- **Product Recommender**:
    ...

# Data
I got the data needed to train my AI models from the below sources:
- Products:
    - Product data was generated by the LLM.
    - Images were downloaded from the web and were hosted by Amazon and others.
- Amazon Reviews:
    - URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tarkkaanko/amazon
    - Number of rows: 4,915
    - Size: 1.6 MB
