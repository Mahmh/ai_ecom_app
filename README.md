# AI-Powered E-Commerce Website
<u>Problem statement</u>: A fictional e-commerce company named "EcomGo" wants to integrate AI technology in their website to enhance user experience and customer satisfaction. Their plan was to add the following AI-powered features:

- **Chatbot Assistant**: It uses a large language model (LLM) that has access to the company's internal database of products and other helpful information (e.g., delivery info, product discounts).
- **Review Analyst**: The company considers using an internal model that reads a user's review on a particular product to determine their message's sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative). Reviews with positive sentiment are colored green in the website, ones with negative are colored red, whereas the neutral ones are colored white; in addition, reviews with the same sentiment are grouped together. This AI feature is useful for users as they can quickly estimate the public's opinion about a specific product before buying it.
- **Product Recommender**: A custom trained AI model is used to recommend products to users based on their preferences and purchasing style.

<u>Solution</u>: This is where they hire me to implement and integrate all of these features into the web application.

# AI Models
Here is a more detailed description for each aforementioned model:
- **Chatbot Assistant**:
    1. Queries the internal database.
    2. Stores the top relevant results in an index for better retrieval.
    3. Retrieves them as embedded information.
    4. Decides to use which information to properly answer a user's question.
- **Review Analyst**:
    1. A self-hosted Llama 3 model (8B parameters) for analyzing sentiments intelligently.
    2. Preprocesses and postprocesses user and output data respectively.
    3. Predicts and displays the sentiment of the user on a product given only their review about it.
- **Product Recommender**:
